# Security-Enhanced Docker Configuration

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Docker setup for Pioneertown.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Container runs as non-root user** (nginx-custom, UID 1001)
- ✅ Builder stage runs with dedicated `nodejs` user (UID 1001)
- ✅ Production stage runs with `nginx-custom` user (UID 1001)
- ✅ All files have proper ownership and permissions

### 2. **Secure Base Images**
- ✅ Using Alpine Linux base images (smaller attack surface)
- ✅ Regular security updates applied during build
- ✅ Unnecessary packages removed

### 3. **Enhanced Nginx Security**
- ✅ Server signature hidden (`server_tokens off`)
- ✅ Buffer overflow protection with size limits
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `Content-Security-Policy`
  - `Permissions-Policy`

### 4. **File System Security**
- ✅ Hidden files access blocked (`.htaccess`, `.env`, etc.)
- ✅ Sensitive file extensions blocked (`.yml`, `.conf`, `.sh`, etc.)
- ✅ Version control files blocked (`.git`, `.svn`)
- ✅ Backup files blocked (`*~`, `*.bak`)

### 5. **Build Security**
- ✅ NPM security audit during build
- ✅ Comprehensive `.dockerignore` to prevent sensitive file inclusion
- ✅ Multi-stage build to minimize production image size

### 6. **Runtime Security**
- ✅ Health check endpoint for monitoring
- ✅ Process isolation
- ✅ Read-only file system where possible

## Security Scanning

Use the provided security scan script to verify your container:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t pioneertown .

# Run security scan
./security-scan.sh pioneertown
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

### Production Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS**: Deploy behind a reverse proxy with SSL termination
2. **Network Security**: Use Docker networks to isolate containers
3. **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits
4. **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or external secret management
5. **Image Scanning**: Integrate vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Example Production Deployment with Security
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  pioneertown:
    image: pioneertown:latest
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /var/run
      - /var/cache/nginx
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M
          cpus: '0.5'
```

### Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor container logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for health check failures
- Use security scanning tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore
- Implement log aggregation for security analysis

### Regular Maintenance
- Update base images monthly
- Run `npm audit` and fix vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for used packages
- Test security configurations regularly

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Latest security updates applied
- [ ] No sensitive files in image
- [ ] Container runs as non-root
- [ ] Health checks working
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Vulnerable packages identified and updated
- [ ] Network policies configured
- [ ] Resource limits set
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## Tools Integration

### CI/CD Security Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    docker build -t pioneertown .
    ./security-scan.sh pioneertown
    trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL pioneertown
```

This security-enhanced configuration provides a solid foundation for secure container deployment while maintaining performance and usability.
